Hi everyone, 

MatLab examples are listed in this Repo. Kindly find all the solutions and examples from the Mathematical Skills for Data Scientist Module. 

Here we have:

->  8 Labs (the labs mostly comprised of MatLab assignments )
and

-> 2 Assessed assignments. These are basic Mathematics used In Statistical Data Analysis, like Integration, Differentiation, Matrix, Inverse, covariance, Eigen Values and Eigen vector spaces.
